# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the key modifications and new features implemented in the project.

## 1. Login/Signup and Role-Based Access Control

*   **`App.js` Modifications:**
    *   Imported `Login`, `Signup`, and `ProtectedRoute` components.
    *   Updated routing to include `/login` and `/signup` routes.
    *   Secured `/dashboard` (UserDashboard) and `/admin` (AdminDashboard) routes using `ProtectedRoute` with role-based access control.

*   **`Header.js` Modifications:**
    *   Implemented dynamic display of navigation links based on the user's role (e.g., "Dashboard" for users, "Admin" for administrators, "Login" if no role is present).
    *   Added a "Logout" button for authenticated users.
    *   Updated mobile navigation to mirror the dynamic display and logout functionality of the desktop navigation.
    *   Added an event listener to dynamically update the header on login/logout by listening for a custom `userRoleChanged` event.
    *   Modified `handleLogout` to dispatch the `userRoleChanged` event after clearing the user role from `localStorage`.

*   **`Login.js` Modifications:**
    *   Dispatches a custom `userRoleChanged` event after successful login to trigger dynamic updates in the `Header` component.

*   **`mockData.js` Modifications:**
    *   Added a `mockUsers` array containing user credentials and roles to support mock authentication logic for testing role-based access control.

        *   Incorporated a background image to make the section more visually engaging.
        *   Updated text styling and redesigned the search bar with improved layout, styling, and icon sizing.
    *   **"Featured Properties" Section:**
        *   Improved styling for headings, layout, and text.
